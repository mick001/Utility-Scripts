## Utility scripts
This folder contains some short utility scripts I have written usually to solve repetitive tasks or for making some double checking faster. 
May be they'll be useful to someone, maybe they won't. Who knows, at least they're not sleeping deep inside the hard drive of my computer.

## Scripts included so far

- A script to plot .csv files from the terminal.
- A script to solve treephase electrical circuits.
- A script to calculate the parameters of a mutual inductor.
- A script to calculate the increase in phase margin of a linear system due to a lead network.
- A script to solve linear systems.

## How to run the scripts
In general: simply copy and paste the script in your favourite IDE (or in a .py file) and run it. Some scripts may run from command line. 

Check the description of each script for more information.
