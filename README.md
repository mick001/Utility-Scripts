## Utility scripts
This folder contains some short utility scripts I have written usually to solve repetitive tasks or for making some double checking faster. 
May be they'll be useful to someone, maybe they won't. Who knows, at least they're not sleeping deep inside the hard drive of my computer.

## Scripts included so far

## How to run the scripts
In general: simply copy and paste the script in your favourite IDE (or in a .py file) and run it. Some scripts may run from command line. 

Check the description of each script for confirmation.
